For the learnings!
I'm Hannah - trained in Chemical Engineering, with a passion for learning constantly (languages, facts, history, science, sustainability, philosophy, linguistics, data) and a desire to make a difference in the world. I'm interested in technical writing and editing. I'm very loud and enthusiastic on Twitter.
